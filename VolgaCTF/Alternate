In the given challenge we were given a website a URL [Alternate](https://alternative.q.2020.volgactf.ru:7780/)
So on opening thee website was a complete static website which said

Hello there!

Welcome to our first crypto challenge!

Try to find some secret information here.

So with the curiousity that whats hidden inside it i ran directory search and paramter fuzz with url but failed with no result next i decided to run a nmap scan over the host with port 7780 and aggresive scan 
```
 nmap alternative.q.2020.volgactf.ru -p 7780 -A
 ```
